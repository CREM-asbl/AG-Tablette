This project is an Astro-based web application with a focus on interactive components. It uses Vitest for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing. Firebase is used for backend services.

## Technologies Used

- Astro (Web Framework)
- Node.js (Runtime Environment)
- Vitest (Unit Testing Framework)
- Playwright (End-to-End Testing Framework)
- Firebase (Backend Services)
- ESLint (Linting)
- Prettier (Code Formatting)

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:4321`.

3.  **Build Project**:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command compiles the project for production deployment.

## Testing

-   **Run Unit Tests (Vitest)**:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

-   **Run End-to-End Tests (Playwright)**:

    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    ```

## Code Quality

-   **Linting (ESLint)**:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

-   **Formatting (Prettier)**:

    ```bash
    npm run format
    ```
